# Optimal transport: couplings and the `W₁` Kantorovich cost

Mathlib `v4.31.0` has the Lévy-Prokhorov metric (the topology of weak convergence) but **no**
optimal-transport theory: no couplings, no Wasserstein distances, no Kantorovich duality
(`Axioms/Wasserstein.lean` axiomatizes `W1`/`W2`). This file begins building the real theory (M2),
starting with the two objects everything else rests on: a **coupling** of two measures, and the
**`W₁` Kantorovich transport cost** as the infimum of `∫ dist` over couplings.

We work with the `ℝ≥0∞`-valued cost (`edist`, a total lintegral), which makes the lattice structure
clean: the infimum is always defined, nonnegativity is free, and the basic metric facts
(`W₁ μ μ = 0`, symmetry) are unconditional. This is the substrate on which the Kantorovich-Rubinstein
bound and the triangle inequality (the harder, gluing-based facts) will be built.

## The Kantorovich-Rubinstein bound (one direction)

For a `1`-Lipschitz test function `f`, the dual pairing `∫ f dμ - ∫ f dν` lower-bounds the transport
cost of *every* coupling, hence lower-bounds `W₁`. This is the direction of Kantorovich-Rubinstein
duality the paper uses (the Markov bound, Claim 2). The mechanism: push `f` through both marginals of
a coupling `π`, so the pairing becomes `∫ (f p.1 - f p.2) dπ`, then bound the integrand by
`dist p.1 p.2` (Lipschitz) and integrate.

## The triangle inequality via gluing of couplings

`W₁ μ ρ ≤ W₁ μ ν + W₁ ν ρ`. The classical proof glues a plan `π₁` of `(μ, ν)` and a plan `π₂` of
`(ν, ρ)` along their shared marginal `ν`: disintegrate `π₂ = ν ⊗ₘ κ₂` (its conditional `z | y`), lift
`κ₂` to a kernel on `X × Y` reading only the `Y`-coordinate, and form the triple
`T = π₁ ⊗ₘ (κ₂ ∘ snd)` on `(X × Y) × Z`. The `(X, Y)`-marginal of `T` is `π₁` (free from `fst_compProd`),
the `(Y, Z)`-marginal collapses to `ν ⊗ₘ κ₂ = π₂`, and the `(X, Z)`-marginal `γ` is a coupling of
`(μ, ρ)` whose cost is bounded by `cost π₁ + cost π₂` via `edist x z ≤ edist x y + edist y z`.

## The quadratic Wasserstein cost `W₂²`

The paper's Lemma 5.2 controls `W₂` between two pushforwards of a measure by the `L²` distance of the
maps. We build the quadratic cost in squared form `W₂²` (the infimum of `∫ dist² dπ` over couplings),
staying in `ℝ≥0∞` as for `W₁`, and prove the map-coupling bound witnessed by `(T₁, T₂)_# μ`, together
with the unconditional metric facts. Taking square roots to recover `W₂` itself, and the `W₂` triangle
inequality (Minkowski/gluing), are deferred.

## The `W₂` transport distance and its triangle inequality (Minkowski + gluing)

`W₂ μ ν` is the infimum over couplings of the **root** cost `(∫ dist² dπ)^{1/2}`. Defining it as the
infimum of root costs (rather than `√` of `W₂²`) lets the triangle inequality descend through the two
infima exactly as for `W₁`. The per-coupling bound is Minkowski's inequality for `L²` applied to a
glued triple: `‖x - z‖ ≤ ‖x - y‖ + ‖y - z‖` pointwise, then `ENNReal.lintegral_Lp_add_le` (`p = 2`).

## Convexity of `W₂` under mixtures

The mixture bound `W₂(∑ aₖ Pₖ, ∑ aₖ Qₖ) ≤ ε` (when every `W₂(Pₖ, Qₖ) ≤ ε` and `∑ aₖ = 1`) rests on two
mechanical facts -- a mixture of couplings is a coupling of the mixtures, and the squared cost is
linear in the mixing measure -- plus an `ε`-approximation over the infimum: `W₂` is an infimum
(possibly unattained), so `W₂(Pₖ, Qₖ) ≤ ε` yields, for any slack `η > 0`, a coupling of root cost
`< ε + η`, not one achieving `ε` exactly.
-/

/-- A **mixture of couplings is a coupling of the mixtures**: if `πₖ` couples `(Pₖ, Qₖ)` for each `k`,
then `∑ aₖ • πₖ` couples `(∑ aₖ • Pₖ, ∑ aₖ • Qₖ)`. The marginal map `Prod.fst`/`Prod.snd` is additive
(over the finite sum) and `ℝ≥0∞`-homogeneous (`Measure.map_smul`). -/

## Finiteness of `W₂`

The `ℝ`-valued interface (`Axioms.W2 := (W2 · ·).toReal`) is only faithful where `W₂` is finite: `toReal`
sends `⊤` to `0`, so a hypothesis-free `ℝ` triangle/convexity fact about a possibly-infinite `W₂` would
be unsound. For the paper's measures -- probability measures on the unit sphere -- `W₂` is finite: the
product coupling moves mass across a distance at most the support diameter, so its squared cost is
bounded. This is the finiteness lemma the `W₂` axiom flip needs.
-/

/-- **`W₂` is finite for boundedly-supported probability measures.** If `μ` and `ν` are probability
measures a.e.-supported in the ball of radius `R` (in particular any measures on the unit sphere,
`R = 1`), the product coupling has squared cost at most `(2R)²`, so `W₂ μ ν ≠ ⊤`. -/
