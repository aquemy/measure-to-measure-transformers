# The frozen-field characteristic flow (M3b existence, leaf E2b)

With `frozenBlock` (leaf E2a-4) a genuine well-posed `Block`, the generic `Block.blockFlow` machinery
of `FlowMap.lean` — proven for *every* `Block` (identity at `0`, semigroup, injectivity/bijectivity,
**sphere invariance** for `t ≥ 0` via the radial gate, Grönwall Lipschitz dependence, measurability) —
gives the point flow `Φ^t` of the frozen field `ẋ = attnFieldExt p ν x` essentially for free.

This leaf packages that flow as `frozenFlow p ν` and adds the one fact the generic machinery cannot
state: **on the sphere its velocity is the paper's field** `p.field ν`. On the sphere `attnFieldExt`
equals `p.field ν` (`attnFieldExt_eq_field_of_mem_sphere`), and the flow keeps `Φ^t x` on the sphere,
so the block field's integral-curve derivative `attnFieldExt p ν (Φ^t x)` is exactly
`p.field ν (Φ^t x)` — the `deriv` clause of `IsMeanFieldFlow`, for the **frozen** measure `ν`.

This is the inner step of the mean-field Picard iteration: it solves the characteristic ODE at a fixed
`ν`; the remaining existence work (E-crux/E3) makes `ν` self-consistent with the pushforward
trajectory `(Φ_t)_# μ₀`, via a fixed point in the measure variable.

M3b staging: consumed when `exists_meanFieldFlow` is discharged; see RESEARCH.md.

/-- The **frozen-field characteristic flow**: the point flow of `frozenBlock`, i.e. the solution
operator `Φ^t` of `ẋ = attnFieldExt p ν x` (which on the sphere is `ẋ = p.field ν x`). All the flow
algebra (identity at `0`, sphere invariance, Lipschitz/measurable dependence) is inherited from the
generic `Block.blockFlow`; the new fact is that on the sphere its velocity is the paper's field. -/

/-- **The frozen characteristic ODE on the sphere.** For `x ∈ 𝕊^{d-1}` and `t ≥ 0`, the trajectory
`s ↦ Φ^s x` solves `ẋ = p.field ν x`: the block field's integral curve has velocity
`attnFieldExt p ν (Φ^t x)`, which on the sphere (where the flow stays) is exactly `p.field ν (Φ^t x)`.
This is the `deriv` clause of `IsMeanFieldFlow` for the *frozen* measure `ν` — the inner step of the
mean-field Picard iteration, before `ν` is made self-consistent with `(Φ_t)_# μ₀`. -/
