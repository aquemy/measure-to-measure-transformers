# `W₁` vs weak convergence on `SphereProb`: the easy direction (M3b existence, leaf S3a)

The crux of the Wasserstein completeness sub-campaign (toward `exists_meanFieldFlow`) is that the `W₁`
pseudometric on `SphereProb d` (leaf S2) is uniformly equivalent to the Lévy–Prokhorov / weak metric
banked complete in `SphereMeasureCompletion` (E1). This file records the **easy** half — `W₁` dominates
weak convergence — via Kantorovich–Rubinstein.

* `SphereProb.integrable_of_lipschitz` — a globally `1`-Lipschitz `f : Eucl d → ℝ` is integrable
  against a sphere-supported probability measure (bounded on the sphere ⇒ a.e.-bounded ⇒ integrable);
* `SphereProb.abs_integral_sub_le_dist` — for such `f`, `|∫ f dμ − ∫ f dν| ≤ dist μ ν`, the banked KR
  lower bound `ofReal_integral_sub_le_W1` read through `toReal` (finite by S2a) and symmetrised.

This is the tool that makes `id : (SphereProb, W₁) → (P(sphere), weak)` continuous: `W₁`-convergence
forces integral-convergence against every Lipschitz test function, and on the compact sphere Lipschitz
functions determine weak convergence. The **hard** direction (weak ⇒ `W₁`) and the completeness
transport are the following leaves (S3b/S4).

/-- **Kantorovich–Rubinstein estimate on `SphereProb` (easy direction of the `W₁ ↔ weak` comparison).**
For a globally `1`-Lipschitz test function `f`, the difference of integrals is bounded by the `W₁`
distance: `|∫ f dμ − ∫ f dν| ≤ dist μ ν`. This is the banked KR lower bound `ofReal_integral_sub_le_W1`
symmetrised and read through `toReal` (finite by S2a); it makes `id : (SphereProb, W₁) → (P(sphere),
weak)` continuous (Lipschitz test functions determine weak convergence). -/
