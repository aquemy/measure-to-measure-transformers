# Finite `μ`-continuity-set ball cover of the sphere (M3b existence, leaf S3b-iv-cover)

The topological foundation of the cell-rounding partition in the `weak ⇒ W₁` crux (leaf S3b, toward
`exists_meanFieldFlow`). To build a finite partition of the sphere into small cells whose *boundaries*
carry no `μ`-mass — so that portmanteau (`tendsto_measure_of_null_frontier_of_tendsto`) delivers
cell-mass convergence under weak convergence — one first covers the compact sphere by open balls of
radius `< ε` whose frontiers are `μ`-null, then takes a finite subcover.

* `exists_finite_null_frontier_ball_cover` — for a finite measure `μ` and `ε > 0`, a finite set `F` of
  centres and a radius assignment `rr` with every `rr x ∈ (0, ε)`, every ball `Metric.ball x (rr x)`
  having `μ`-null frontier, and `⋃ x ∈ F, ball x (rr x)` covering the sphere.

The `μ`-null-frontier radius at each centre comes from Mathlib's `exists_null_frontier_thickening`
(`thickening r {x} = ball x r`), which encodes that only countably many radii give a positive-measure
sphere; the finite subcover from `isCompact_sphere` (`Eucl d` is a proper space).

M3b staging: consumed when `exists_meanFieldFlow` is discharged; see RESEARCH.md.

/-- **Finite `μ`-null-frontier ball cover of the sphere.** For a finite measure `μ` and `ε > 0`, the
compact sphere is covered by finitely many open balls of radius `< ε` whose frontiers are `μ`-null.
Each centre gets a radius in `(0, ε)` avoiding the countably many positive-`μ`-mass sphere radii
(`exists_null_frontier_thickening`); `isCompact_sphere` then extracts a finite subcover. -/
