# Assembly: a connected, prescribed-mass partition of the sphere (Proposition 2.2)

The final assembly of Steps A-C into `prop_2_2`'s connected-prescribed-mass partition: given `d ≥ 3`
and any strictly increasing sequence of cumulative mass targets `m₀=0 < m₁ < ... < m_M=1`, the
sphere splits into `M` pieces `P₀,...,P_{M-1}` such that each `Pₖ` is *connected*, has *exact* mass
`mₖ₊₁ - mₖ`, and is measure-disjoint from every other piece.

**The construction.** Pick a generic atomless direction `u` (Step A). Simultaneously extract a
threshold `tₖ` for every cumulative target `mₖ` (Step B, bundled over the whole index family via
`choose`; monotonicity of the resulting `t` follows from strict monotonicity of `m` plus
monotonicity of the underlying CDF). Each piece `Pₖ := {x ∈ sphere d | tₖ ≤ ⟪u,x⟫ ≤ tₖ₊₁}` is then
connected by Step C (`d ≥ 3`), has mass `mₖ₊₁ - mₖ` by a slab/threshold bookkeeping identity, and is
measure-disjoint from any other piece because two slabs can only meet at a shared endpoint
`{x | ⟪u,x⟫ = tⱼ}`, which is null (Step B's threshold-is-null guarantee).

Pieces are "measure-disjoint," not literally set-disjoint: adjacent closed slabs `[tₖ,tₖ₊₁]` and
`[tₖ₊₁,tₖ₊₂]` share the single level set `{x|⟪u,x⟫=tₖ₊₁}`, which carries zero mass but is not
literally empty. This is the natural granularity for a measure-theoretic partition and lets every
piece reuse Step C's *closed*-slab connectedness directly (a half-open slab's connectedness would
need re-deriving Step C's argument on `Ico`/`Ioc` instead of `Icc`).

This leaf reduces `prop_2_2`'s discharge to the two remaining obligations already identified this
session: the "gated schedule" that steers each piece into place while parking the others
(`Leaves/DiscreteClustering.lean`'s docstring), and the combination glue (already banked there,
`measureFlow_W2_discrete_of_perPiece`, PR #91) — this leaf supplies the `Pₖ`'s those consume.
