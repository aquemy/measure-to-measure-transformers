# Leaf (Lemma 3.4 Part 1, Path I assembly): a pole strictly inside the cap, off one point

The App. B.3 collapse pole `ω = x*` is chosen by the pigeonhole to *separate* the two collapsed
barycenters: any `ω` off the single forced vector `v = c⁻¹(∫_{capᶜ}(ν−μ))` works. But `ω` must be a
**unit** vector strictly inside the gate cap `{cos R < ⟪z, ·⟫}`, so the Euclidean-ball pigeonhole of
L3a does not directly apply — the pole ranges over a *spherical* cap.

This leaf supplies the missing geometry: given a unit `w ⊥ z`, the two rotations
`ω± = c·z ± s·w` (with `c = (1+cos R)/2 ∈ (cos R, 1)`, `s = √(1−c²) > 0`) are **distinct** unit vectors
both strictly inside the cap (`⟪z, ω±⟫ = c > cos R`). Two distinct points cannot both equal `v`, so one
of them is the pole. The unit `w ⊥ z` exists exactly when `2 ≤ d` (supplied by the assembly, which
derives it from `μ ≠ ν`).

The pole `ω` returned is literally `c·z ± s·w`, hence lies in `span{z,w}` — exposed as the extra
conjunct `ω = ⟪z,ω⟫•z + ⟪w,ω⟫•w` (`hωspan` below), consumed by `lemma_3_4_part2`'s Gap 2 wiring
(`Leaves/Lemma34Part1MeanField.lean`): since `Sμ•ω+p`'s component orthogonal to `span{z,w}`
(`restComp z w`, `Leaves/CollapseColinearityAvoidance.lean`) only drops the `Sμ•ω` term when `ω`
itself has zero rest-component, which needs exactly this span membership (not just a bound on
`⟪z,ω⟫`, which alone doesn't pin `ω` into `span{z,w}` in dimension `> 2`).

/-- **Spherical-cap pigeonhole for the pole.** Given a unit `w` orthogonal to the unit cap direction
`z`, and any forbidden vector `v`, there is a unit vector `ω` strictly inside the cap
`{cos R < ⟪z, ·⟫}` with `ω ≠ v`. Realised by the two cap rotations `c·z ± s·w`, which are distinct unit
vectors with `⟪z, ·⟫ = c > cos R`; at most one equals `v`. The pole also comes with a `span{z,w}`
membership certificate `hωspan`, needed by `lemma_3_4_part2`'s Gap 2 wiring to drop `ω`'s contribution
from a rest-component (see the file docstring). -/
