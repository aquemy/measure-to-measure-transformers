# Labeled axioms: Wasserstein distance and optimal transport

Mathlib `v4.31.0` has no developed optimal-transport theory: it provides the Lévy-Prokhorov metric
and the topology of weak convergence, but not the Wasserstein distances `W_p`, Kantorovich-
Rubinstein duality, or transport-map existence. The paper uses all of these. We introduce them here
as clearly labeled axioms. Every downstream result that touches them is therefore `math.axiomatised`
(its CKC effective status is the minimum over its dependency closure), not `math.machine-checked`.

These declarations are faithful to the standard theory; replacing them with a real Mathlib
development is the (multi-year) way to discharge them.

/-- AXIOM: the quadratic Wasserstein distance `W_2` between (Borel) measures on `ℝ^d`.
Absent from Mathlib `v4.31.0`. -/
axiom W2 (μ ν : Measure (Eucl d)) : ℝ

/-- AXIOM: `W_2` is nonnegative. -/
axiom W2_nonneg (μ ν : Measure (Eucl d)) : 0 ≤ W2 μ ν

/-- AXIOM: `W_2` is symmetric. -/
axiom W2_comm (μ ν : Measure (Eucl d)) : W2 μ ν = W2 ν μ

/-- AXIOM: `W_2` satisfies the triangle inequality. -/
axiom W2_triangle (μ ν ρ : Measure (Eucl d)) : W2 μ ρ ≤ W2 μ ν + W2 ν ρ

/-- AXIOM (the content of Lemma 5.2, map-induced coupling bound): the `W_2` distance between two
pushforwards of `μ` is controlled by the `L²(μ)` distance of the maps. This is the optimal-transport
fact that Lemma 5.2 invokes; with no Mathlib `W_2` it is taken as an axiom. -/
axiom W2_map_le_L2 (μ : Measure (Eucl d)) (T₁ T₂ : Eucl d → Eucl d) :
    W2 (μ.map T₁) (μ.map T₂) ≤ Real.sqrt (∫ x, ‖T₁ x - T₂ x‖ ^ 2 ∂μ)

/-- AXIOM (Kantorovich-Rubinstein duality, the `W_1` form used for the Markov bound, Claim 2):
`W_1(μ, ν)` equals the supremum over `1`-Lipschitz test functions of `∫ f dμ - ∫ f dν`. We expose the
one direction the paper uses, that any `1`-Lipschitz `f` lower-bounds `W_1`. -/
axiom W1 (μ ν : Measure (Eucl d)) : ℝ

axiom W1_ge_of_lipschitz (μ ν : Measure (Eucl d)) (f : Eucl d → ℝ)
    (hf : LipschitzWith 1 f) : ∫ x, f x ∂μ - ∫ x, f x ∂ν ≤ W1 μ ν

/-- AXIOM (convexity of `W₂` under mixtures). For probability measures, the `W₂` distance between two
convex combinations sharing the same weights is at most the uniform bound on the component distances.
This is the gluing-of-couplings estimate `W₂(∑ aₖ Pₖ, ∑ aₖ Qₖ)² ≤ ∑ aₖ W₂(Pₖ, Qₖ)²` (couple each pair
optimally and sum the couplings), packaged in the form actually used: if every component is within
`ε`, so is the mixture. A standard optimal-transport fact, absent from Mathlib `v4.31.0`. -/
axiom W2_convexCombo_le {M : ℕ} (a : Fin M → ℝ≥0∞) (P Q : Fin M → Measure (Eucl d))
    (ha : ∑ k, a k = 1) (ε : ℝ) (hε : 0 ≤ ε)
    (hP : ∀ k, IsProbabilityMeasure (P k)) (hQ : ∀ k, IsProbabilityMeasure (Q k))
    (hbound : ∀ k, W2 (P k) (Q k) ≤ ε) :
    W2 (∑ k, a k • P k) (∑ k, a k • Q k) ≤ ε
