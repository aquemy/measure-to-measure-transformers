# The continuity equation and its flow map (formerly axiomatised, now discharged)

The paper's central object is the continuity equation (1.3) on the sphere and its solution map
`Φ_θ^t : 𝒫(𝕊^{d-1}) → 𝒫(𝕊^{d-1})`. Historically this file *axiomatised* the well-posedness package
(the block type, the point flow map, and its Lipschitz / bijectivity / parked laws), because Mathlib
has no theory of the continuity equation or mean-field flow maps.

The M3 foundation (`Foundations/FlowMap.lean`) now **builds** that package from Mathlib's
Picard-Lindelöf and Grönwall: a `Block` is a globally-Lipschitz, globally-bounded, radially-tangent
velocity field with a duration, and `flowMap θ t` is the fold of the per-block characteristic flows.
This file therefore no longer introduces axioms: it `export`s the concrete `Block` / `flowMap` into
the `Axioms` namespace (so every downstream `Axioms.Block` / `Axioms.flowMap` reference is an alias to
the *same* declaration -- no collision, no re-axiomatisation) and re-derives the structural interface
as ordinary theorems. The old axiom names survive as theorems with identical signatures, so no
consumer changes.

/- Discharged: the block type is the concrete `MeasureToMeasure.Block` -- a globally-Lipschitz,
globally-bounded, radially-tangent velocity field with a nonnegative duration; `flowMap` is the fold of
the per-block characteristic flows; `Params` is the block list and `switches` its length. `export`
(rather than fresh definitions) makes `Axioms.Block` / `Axioms.flowMap` / `Axioms.Params` /
`Axioms.switches` *aliases* of the Foundations declarations, so the two layers share a single
declaration each and never collide in a consumer that has both namespaces open. A piecewise-constant
schedule `θ` is thus a finite list of blocks: composition is concatenation, the identity schedule is
the empty list, time-reversal reverses (and negates) the blocks, and the switch count is the block
count -- the schedule algebra is *proved*, not assumed. -/

/-- The solution map `Φ_θ^t : 𝒫(𝕊^{d-1}) → 𝒫(𝕊^{d-1})` of the continuity equation, acting on
measures. **Defined** as the pushforward of the point flow map `flowMap θ t` -- this is precisely the
continuity equation's defining property (mass is transported along characteristics). With this,
`measureFlow_map` is definitional and the semigroup laws (`measureFlow_comp`, `_id`, `_inv`) are
*derived* from the point-level flow facts plus `Measure.map_map` / `Measure.map_id`. -/

curve is constant, so the whole schedule fixes the point. Discharged from
