# Blueprint statements: the main results (Theorems 1.1 and 1.2) and disentanglement (Prop 3.1)

These are the headline targets of the paper. **Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are proved here by assembly**:
their proofs combine the mid-level results (`Statements/MidLevel.lean`) and the structural flow
algebra (`Axioms/Dynamics.lean`) along the paper's construction
`Φ_fin = (Φ_θ₁)⁻¹ ∘ Φ_θ₂ ∘ Φ_θ₁` (disentangle, act, re-compose), so the kernel verifies the logical
skeleton. Their effective CKC status is therefore `math.axiomatised` (the minimum over the documented
axiom surface they rest on), *not* `math.open`.

The hypotheses of the paper are now **concrete definitions** (a shared missing direction; pairwise
matchability by a *measurable* transport map; pairwise disjoint supports), so the proofs genuinely
consume and produce them.

`prop_3_1` (disentanglement) is stated as a faithful **axiom**: its honest proof is the Section 3.3
induction that produces explicit pairwise-disjoint supports from Lemmas 3.2-3.4 and the
non-colinearity leaf L11, a large standalone formalization. The two main theorems are assembled over
it. Two structural composition mechanisms the paper uses but Mathlib cannot supply are likewise
labeled axioms: `exists_parked_schedule` (one schedule acting on a disjoint-support family, the
Appendix B parking construction) and `cluster_to_point` (single-measure controllability, in
`MidLevel.lean`).

/-- There is a unit direction `ω` off the (closed) support of every measure in the family

/-- Each input/target pair is matchable by some *measurable* transport map (the minimal assumption of
Theorem 1.2). Measurability is part of "transport map" and is needed for the pushforward to be the
target rather than the zero measure. -/

/-- AXIOM (geometric output of the disentanglement dynamics, Section 3.3). Under a shared missing
direction, one schedule concentrates each measure of the family into a small ball
`B(α i, r)` (`r < 1`) around a *unit* direction `α i`, with the directions pairwise separated by at
least `2 r`. This is exactly what Lemmas 3.2 (rotate into the orthant), 3.3 (shrink each hull onto its
barycenter direction) and 3.4 (make barycenter directions pairwise non-colinear) produce, run as the
Section 3.3 induction; the leaf L11 (`barycenter_noncolinear_of_disjoint_hull`) is the geometric core.
The dynamical construction rests on the missing continuity-equation theory, so it is axiomatized at
this concrete geometric level. `Depends-On` Lemmas 3.2-3.4 and leaf L11. -/

/-- **Proposition 3.1** (disentanglement). Under a shared missing direction there is a schedule whose
solution map renders the family's supports pairwise disjoint, each concentrated in an open
hemisphere.

**Proved** (effective `math.axiomatised`): the dynamical construction is captured by
`exists_disentangling_balls` (the concrete output of Lemmas 3.2-3.4), and this proof discharges the
geometric packaging the paper states without proof (review finding F2): from balls around unit
directions separated by `2 r` we machine-check that (i) the carrier balls are pairwise *disjoint*
(`Metric.ball_disjoint_ball`), and (ii) each ball lies in the open hemisphere `{x | 0 < ⟪α i, x⟫}`
(Cauchy-Schwarz: `‖x - α i‖ < r < 1` forces `⟪α i, x⟫ > 1 - r > 0`). -/

tolerance a single piecewise-constant `θ` steers each input to within `ε` of its point-mass target
`δ_{x i}` in `W₂`.

**Proved** by assembly: disentangle the family (`prop_3_1`), cluster each disentangled measure to its
target point in its hemisphere (`cluster_to_point`), combine the per-member schedules into one with
the parking construction (`exists_parked_schedule`), and pre-compose with the disentangler
(`comp`, `measureFlow_comp`). Effective status `math.axiomatised`. -/

/-- **Theorem 1.2** (general targets). If every input/target pair is matchable by a (measurable)
transport map and the inputs share a missing direction, then a single piecewise-constant `θ` steers
each input to within `ε` of its target in `W₂`.

**Proved** by assembly: disentangle the inputs (`prop_3_1`); each disentangled measure `ν₀ i` is then
matchable to `μ₁ i` by `Ti ∘ (Φ_{θ₁}⁻¹)` (using `measureFlow_inv`/`measureFlow_map`); approximate that
transport map by a flow (`lemma_5_4`) and bound `W₂` by the `L²` map distance (the coupling axiom L7,
`W2_map_le_L2`); finally park the per-member schedules into one (`exists_parked_schedule`) and
pre-compose with the disentangler. Effective status `math.axiomatised`; the `W₂` bookkeeping is
machine-checked. -/
