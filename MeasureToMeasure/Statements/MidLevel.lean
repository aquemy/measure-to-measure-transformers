# Mid-level statements: the connective lemmas of Sections 2-5 and Appendix B

The kernel-checked leaves (L1-L11) capture the self-contained computational cores, and
`Statements/MainResults.lean` states the three headline theorems. This file fills the gap: the
mid-level lemmas the paper chains together (Propositions 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2; Lemmas 3.2, 3.3, 3.4;
Lemmas 5.1, 5.4; Lemmas B.1, B.2).

## Status policy (closing the open statements)

Each mid-level result rests on machinery Mathlib does not have (continuity-equation flow existence,
LaSalle / Hartman-Grobman, optimal transport, geodesic convexity). Those are **irreducible analytic
facts**: we state them as clearly labeled `axiom`s (status `math.axiomatised`), each citing the paper
section and the classical theorem it encodes, and each `Depends-On` the kernel-checked geometric leaf
that supplies its self-contained core. This is sound only because every axiom is a *true*, standard
statement; where the original type-correct stub was a loose transcription we correct it to the
faithful form first (see `lemma_B_1` / `lemma_B_2`).

`lemma_B_1` is **proved** (not axiomatized): it is a genuine assembly of `lemma_B_2` and the
structural flow algebra (`Axioms/Dynamics.lean`) by induction on the length of the ball chain, so its
mass-retention bound is machine-checked given the single-ball transport fact.

/-- **Lemma 3.3** (shrink a measure's hull toward its barycenter direction). For any tolerance the
measure can be concentrated into a small ball around some direction `α`. AXIOM
(`math.axiomatised`): the contraction is driven by the barycenter dynamics (leaf L6) but its

/-- **Proposition 4.2** (steer one active point). With `d ≥ 3`, distinct inputs/targets, and the
inactive points (the first `M-1`) already at their targets, at most `6` switches move every input to
its target, keeping the inactive ones fixed. AXIOM (`math.axiomatised`): the gather/corridor/restore
construction is a geodesic gradient flow. Step 1 is leaf L3, the geodesic gradient is leaf L4.

The injectivity hypotheses are required for soundness: the flow map is bijective
(`flowMap_bijective`), so steering `x₀ (M-1)` to `y (M-1)` while fixing the inactive points is
possible only if the targets (and inputs) are distinct -- otherwise the map would need two preimages
for one point. The original stub omitted them. -/

/-- **Proposition 4.1** (match an ensemble). With `d ≥ 3` and distinct inputs/targets, at most `6M`
switches steer every `x₀ i` to `y i`.

**Proved** (effective `math.axiomatised`) by induction on `M` over Proposition 4.2 and the structural
flow algebra. Base case `M = 0`: the identity schedule (`idParams`, `0` switches). Step `M = k+1`:
place the first `k` points by the induction hypothesis on the subfamily `x₀ ∘ castSucc`,
`y ∘ castSucc` (`≤ 6k` switches), giving a schedule `φ`; then one Proposition 4.2 step moves the last
point to `y (last)` while the first `k` -- now at their targets via `φ`, so the `hfix` hypothesis
holds -- stay fixed (`≤ 6` switches); compose with `comp`. The switch budget is `6k + 6 = 6(k+1)`
(`switches_comp`), and `flowMap_comp` gives the conclusion for every index at once. The injectivity
needed for the Proposition 4.2 step is exactly `flowMap φ T ∘ x₀` injective (bijective flow composed
with injective `x₀`) and `y` injective. `Depends-On prop_4_2`. -/

/-- **Clustering to a prescribed point** (Proposition 2.1 followed by Proposition 4.1). A measure in
an open hemisphere can be driven `W₂`-close to the Dirac mass at *any chosen* point `z`: first cluster
it to a point (Proposition 2.1), then steer that point to `z` (Proposition 4.1, here with a single
active point). AXIOM (`math.axiomatised`): a combination of the two axiomatized propositions; it is
the single-measure controllability fact that Theorem 1.1 lifts to a family by disentanglement and
parking. `Depends-On prop_2_1`, `Depends-On prop_4_1`. -/

/-- **Lemma 5.1** (transport map after disentanglement). If each disentangled pair is matchable, a
single bijective map matches them all. AXIOM (`math.axiomatised`): gluing the per-pair transport maps

lacks. -/

/-- **Lemma 5.4** (`L²` approximation by a flow map). Any transport map `ψ` is approximated in
`L²(μ)` by a flow map of the dynamics, to any tolerance, with finitely many switches. AXIOM
(`math.axiomatised`): the density of attention-flow maps in `L²` rests on the missing
continuity-equation theory. Combined with the coupling bound (leaf L7) this controls `W₂`. The
approximant `ψε` is measurable and the displacement is `L²`-integrable -- both implicit in the `∫`
bound being meaningful, made explicit so the `W₂` map bound (`W2_map_le_L2`) can consume them. -/

/-- **Lemma B.2** (single ball pair). Mass in `ℬ₀` is pushed into `ℬ₀ ∩ ℬ₁`, retaining a `(1-ε)`
fraction, with a single parameter switch. AXIOM (`math.axiomatised`): the ReLU-gated transport is the
construction of Appendix B (review finding F1: the paper's printed gate parameters have the
activation side reversed; the corrected sign is `U = +z 1ᵀ, b = -cos(R) 1`, see `ERRATA.md`). The
gate algebra and the "active iff inside the ball" fact are the kernel-checked leaf L2
(`gate_pos_iff_dist`). Note the `switches θ ≤ 1` bound, which the original type-correct stub omitted;
it is needed (and true: one switch per ball) for the chain bound in `lemma_B_1`. -/

    ∃ θ : Params d, switches θ ≤ 1 ∧
      (1 - ENNReal.ofReal ε) * μ B₀ ≤ (measureFlow θ T μ) (B₀ ∩ B₁)

/-- **Lemma B.1** (ball-chain retention). For a chain of `K+1` consecutively overlapping balls, `K`
switches retain a `(1-ε)^K` fraction of the mass initially in `ℬ₀` into the last ball `ℬ_K`.

**Proved** (`math.axiomatised`, the only axioms are `lemma_B_2` and the structural flow algebra): a
genuine induction on `K`. The base case is the identity schedule (`idParams`); each step composes a
single-ball `lemma_B_2` transport via `comp`, using `measureFlow_comp` to carry the previous mass
forward, `measure_mono` to pass from `ℬ_k ∩ ℬ_{k+1}` to `ℬ_{k+1}`, and `switches_comp` for the budget.

The statement is corrected from the original type-correct stub: the retained fraction multiplies
`μ ℬ₀` (the mass that starts in the first ball, funneled along the chain), not `μ (⋃ ℬ_k)` (the latter
makes the `K = 0` base case false, since `ℬ₀ ⊆ ⋃ ℬ_k`). The chain-overlap hypothesis `hchain` and the
per-step switch bound (now in `lemma_B_2`) are likewise required for the bound to hold. -/

/-- AXIOM (parking / simultaneous action, Appendix B). If a family of measures has pairwise disjoint
supports and each member can be steered to within `ε` of its target by *some* schedule, then a
*single* schedule steers all of them simultaneously to within `ε`: each member's schedule is gated to
its (disjoint) support region and parks on the others (`flowMap_id_on_parked`). Mathlib has no
continuity-equation theory to derive this, so it is a labeled structural axiom. -/

/-- Atomless decomposition (Sierpiński/Lyapunov splitting). An atomless probability measure splits
into `M` probability measures `P k` with prescribed convex weights `α k` (`∑ α k = 1`, each `α k ≠ 0`)
and pairwise disjoint supports: `μ = ∑ α k • P k`.

**Proved** (`Foundations.exists_probability_decomposition`): the pieces are the normalized restrictions
`P k = (α k)⁻¹ • μ.restrict (A k)` to a prescribed-mass disjoint partition `A k`, which is carved by
iterating **Sierpiński's intermediate-value theorem** for nonatomic measures. The bespoke partition
axiom is thereby removed; what remains is the single primitive
`Foundations.exists_measurableSet_subset_measure_eq` (that IVT, absent from Mathlib `v4.31.0`; Fremlin,
*Measure Theory* Vol. 2, §215D). Positive weights (`α k ≠ 0`) are assumed so each normalized piece is a
genuine probability measure; a zero-weight atom is vacuous for a discrete target.

Soundness note: an earlier form additionally required each piece to sit in an open hemisphere. That
clause is inconsistent at `M = 1` -- it would force the whole measure into a half-space through the
origin, which no centrally-symmetric atomless measure (a Gaussian, or the uniform law on a ball or
sphere) satisfies -- so it is dropped here. The hemisphere is instead acquired dynamically per piece
inside `prop_2_2` (rotate into the orthant via `lemma_3_2`), the way the paper actually proceeds. -/

/-- **Proposition 2.2** (clustering to a discrete measure). An atomless probability measure can be
driven `W₂`-close to a prescribed `M`-atom discrete measure `∑ α k • δ_{x k}` (convex weights,
`∑ α k = 1`, each `α k ≠ 0`). Needs `0 < d` (a basis direction is used to place each piece in a
hemisphere).

**Proved** (effective `math.axiomatised`): partition `μ` into probability pieces `P k` of mass `α k`
with pairwise disjoint supports (`exists_atomless_partition`); for each piece, rotate it into the
orthant with one switch (`lemma_3_2`) -- the orthant lies in the open hemisphere `{x | 0 < ⟪e_j, x⟫}`
of a basis direction `e_j` -- then cluster it to its target point `x k` (`cluster_to_point`),
composing the two schedules (`measureFlow_comp`). A single parked schedule `Θ` runs all pieces at once
(`exists_parked_schedule`); the solution map distributes over the convex combination
(`measureFlow_sum_smul`), and convexity of `W₂` under mixtures (`W2_convexCombo_le`) lifts the
per-piece bounds to the whole measure. The convex-combination bookkeeping is machine-checked. -/
